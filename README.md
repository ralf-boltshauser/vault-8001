# Vault 8001
## Done
- [x] redo the fighting mechanic to be like SAP

## Todos
- [ ] build observability of the game that i can at every turn track how much capital or value a player has to then later investigate what are exploitable patterns

## Ideas
- [ ] banks gain more cash over time
- [ ] when a bank was successfully robbed, it's cash is reduced, and the guards are increased
- [ ] different kind of crew members with different skills and costs
- [ ] estimate how many guards there are and not direct number
- [ ] public dashboard
  - [ ] show banks and how much cash they have and the range of their guards
  - [ ] show information a spy publishes
  - [ ] news paper
    - [ ] can publish information that players write to it
    - [ ] can publish information about crews and their actions
    - [ ] can publish information about the major
- [ ] publisher -> an ai agent that you can write to and it will publish information to the public dashboard
- [ ] spies
  - [ ] can publish information to damage reputation of a crew
  - [ ] can destroy information and gain reputation
- [ ] desktop / tv screen
  - [ ] display news
  - [ ] major auction
  - [ ] 
- [ ] in game communication
- [ ] chat
  - [ ] cleared daily
  - [ ] can be jammed / off sometimes
  - [ ] can be hacked
- [ ] hacker can also jam one specific person
- [ ] for final SNB heist there are two kind of tasks
  - [ ] global tasks like turning off security system
  - [ ] private tasks to increase your own odds (e.g. scouting for guards)
- [ ] major that can set amount of guards at a bank
  - [ ] major is assigned during an anonymous english auction
  - [ ] sticks for 5 turns
  - [ ] major can stop his term early
- [ ] you can tip off banks and gain money if your bid is correct
- [ ] players can just send money between each other

## Bugs
- [ ] hostile crew members with phone have no effect
- [ ] default working
- [ ] phone not working if hostile crew fight
- [ ] who wrote me also show in chat
- [ ] robin suddenly out
- [ ] moving money is important
