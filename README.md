- [ ] for final SNB heist there are two kind of tasks
  - [ ] global tasks like turning off security system
  - [ ] private tasks to increase your own odds (e.g. scouting for guards)
- [ ] major that can set amount of guards at a bank
  - [ ] major is assigned during an anonymous english auction
  - [ ] sticks for 5 turns
  - [ ] major can stop his term early
