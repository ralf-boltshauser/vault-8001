# Vault 8001
## Done
- [x] redo the fighting mechanic to be like SAP

## Todos
- [ ] settings aka resetting the game and not needing to clear the browser storage
- [ ] dynamic banks based on amount of players
- [ ] ensure that in the early phase the gap is not opening between players

## Ideas
- [ ] banks gain more cash over time
- [ ] when a bank was successfully robbed, it's cash is reduced, and the guards are increased
- [ ] different kind of crew members with different skills and costs
- [ ] estimate how many guards there are and not direct number
- [ ] public dashboard
  - [ ] show banks and how much cash they have and the range of their guards
  - [ ] show information a spy publishes
  - [ ] news paper
    - [ ] can publish information that players write to it
    - [ ] can publish information about crews and their actions
    - [ ] can publish information about the major
- [ ] publisher -> an ai agent that you can write to and it will publish information to the public dashboard
- [ ] spies
  - [ ] can publish information to damage reputation of a crew
  - [ ] can destroy information and gain reputation
- [ ] desktop / tv screen
  - [ ] display news
  - [ ] major auction
  - [ ] 
- [ ] in game communication
- [ ] chat
  - [ ] cleared daily
  - [ ] can be jammed / off sometimes
  - [ ] can be hacked
- [ ] hacker can also jam one specific person
- [ ] for final SNB heist there are two kind of tasks
  - [ ] global tasks like turning off security system
  - [ ] private tasks to increase your own odds (e.g. scouting for guards)
- [ ] major that can set amount of guards at a bank
  - [ ] major is assigned during an anonymous english auction
  - [ ] sticks for 5 turns
  - [ ] major can stop his term early
- [ ] you can tip off banks and gain money if your bid is correct
- [ ] reset whole player standing after looting smb aka being raided and needing to restart from the ground up to gain more money
- [ ] a map where crews are placed in the actual city and they can fight against each other and gain more control over the city and also over buildings in the city which they can use to wash money
- [ ] Public Events: Special high-risk, high-reward banks or heists are announced, drawing all players into competitive situations.
- [ ] players can play as the city and defend banks etc
- [ ] elite troops that have higher odds of success, but also higher costs
- [ ] more a mechanic to upgrade your crew instead of just buying new ones
